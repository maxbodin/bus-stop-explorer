## ✨ Overview

The **La Rochelle Bus Stop Explorer** is an interactive map built with Leaflet that tracks the bus stops my friend Bastien and I have visited in La Rochelle. Our goal is to explore every bus stop in the city, and this map showcases our progress. 🚌✨

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To view the map, simply open the project in your browser. You can zoom in and out and click on the bus stops to see their names. Each visited bus stop is represented by a picture of me and my friend in front of it.
